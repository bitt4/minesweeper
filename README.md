# minesweeper

Clone of Windows Minesweeper
I should probably make it object oriented one day.

Edit `include/consts.hpp` to change board width and height.

Yeah the code is very ugly, but I will make a better version one day.

## Dependencies
 - SDL2

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/bitt4/minesweeper.git
cd minesweeper
make
./minesweeper
```
